Untreated diabetes can cause damage or failure of \"the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other body organs.\" Section 10 lists fatigue and \"an abnormally high level of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia)\" as symptoms of Type I diabetes.  The encyclopedia also mentions hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), caused by various hormone disorders and liver disease, as well as by too much insulin.  Brain damage can occur from glucose levels below 40 mg/dL and coma from levels above 470 mg/dL.\n",
